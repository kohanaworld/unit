# Maintenance and support guidelines

Going forward, NGINX Unit will no longer receive new features or
enhancements from the project maintainers. NGINX Unit is still open to
community contributions.

The team is focusing its limited capacity to keep NGINX Unit stable,
secure and high-quality. Its focus will be on critical maintenance, such
as for security issues, dependency upgrades, and resolving crashes or
undefined behavior.
